# My Journey from Dreaming to Doing

My real adventure began after school in 2017, when I started exploring the internet. With only a simple laptop from the government, which I first used just to watch movies, I became curious. I wanted to know how the internet worked, how computers did what they did. This wasn't something I was taught; I had to learn it all by myself. And as I learned, my love for technology grew. I dreamed of studying engineering, but it seemed impossible. Money was tight, and in my village, I was among the few who even thought about such things.

But I didn't let go of my dream. I shared it with my family, convincing them bit by bit that it was possible, that it was worth the effort. I managed to enroll in a college nearby to study computer science engineering, stepping into a world unknown to me.

## Facing Challenges

College brought its challenges. English didn't come easy, math was a struggle, and the thought of big entrance exams was daunting. But I kept pushing because I believed in my dream. I understood that if I just sat and thought about what I wanted, nothing would happen.

## The Lesson

This story tells us something important. It's easy to get caught up in our heads, thinking and dreaming. But dreams only come true when we start moving towards them. It doesn't matter where you're from or how small you start. What matters is taking that first step, learning, and not giving up.

So, if you're dreaming of something, remember this story. Don't just dream; start doing. It might be slow, it might be hard, but you can get there. Just like I, the dreamer from the small village, found that the first step led me to my dreams.
